# Deep Reinforcement Learning Humanoid Balance Controls Analyzation
Deep Reinforcement Learning Control Theory Research Project at Advanced Robotics Lab in the University of Edinburgh, Scotland, UK.

## Getting Consolidated Data For All Forces
Run `bash DDPGtrials.sh`. Make sure you have shell/bash version 4. Raw data is stored in folder `allData`. Consolidated data stored in folder `finalData`.

## Analyzation Scripts
Analyzation scripts in folder "analyzeChuanyuData". plottingResults.m analyzes packaged data from single force simulation, analysisForces.m analyzes packaged data from all forces.
